Ali is a U3 Bioengineering student in Stream 3: Biomedical, Diagnostics and High Throughput Screening Engineering. He is so passionate about aviation that he decided to go for his commercial pilot license. When he is not flying around Montreal, you will usually find him behind a computer screen coding and solving geeky math problems. The unknown is what gets him up in the morning. Within MinutesToMRSA, Ali divides his time between many aspects of the company including surface chemistry research, device design, and maintaining the website (a new website is on the way!).
